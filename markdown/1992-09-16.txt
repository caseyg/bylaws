        The number of trustees may be fixed or changed from time to time at any meeting of the Board, provided that the notice of the meeting at which such number is to be fixed or changed sets forth the action proposed to be taken.

       [as amended January 10,1979]
Section 1.04. ELECTION OF TRUSTEES
         Trustees in office on the date of adoption of these Bylaws shall serve until the next annual meeting of the Board of Trustees and until their successors are elected and qualified. At such meeting the Board shall be divided into four classes, the first, second and third classes each to consist of, to the extent possible, one-fourth of the whole number of trustees theretofore fixed by the Board, and the fourth class to consist of the persons who shall have
been trustees for life immediately prior to January 26,1972. The trustees comprising the first class shall serve for a term of three years, those comprising the second class for a term of four years, those comprising the third class for a term of five years, and those comprising the fourth class for a term of six years. In every case, each trustee shall continue to serve until a successor is elected and has qualified. At each annual meeting of the Board, beginning in 1975, or in default of election at such meeting, then at any adjournment thereof, the successors of those trustees whose terms then expire or have expired shall be elected by the Board to serve for a full four-year term and until their successors are elected and have qualified. At the annual meeting of the Board held in 1974, there shall be created a class of the Board to consist of not more than three trustees, to be known as Alumni trustees. At each annual meeting of the Board, or in default of election at such meeting, then at any adjournment thereof, there may be elected by the Board an Alumni trustee to serve for a four-year term and until his successor is elected and has qualified. Notice of any pending election to the Board shall be entered in the minutes of at least one preceding regular meeting of the Board. At the designated meeting, or at any regularly adjourned meeting from that meeting, such election shall be held by ballot. The nominee first receiving a number of affirmative votes equal to at least a majority of the trustees then in office shall be elected to fill the first vacancy. The voting shall continue in this manner until all such vacancies are filled. If any person so elected declines to act as a trustee, the vacancy filled by his election shall be deemed to be again created. Any vacancy in the Board resulting from any cause whatsoever (including, but not limited to, an increase in the number of authorized trustees or the resignation of a trustee) may be filled for the duration of the unexpired term by the Board of Trustees at any meeting thereof, provided that the notice of such pending election, as entered in the minutes of at least one preceding regular meeting of such Board, states the meeting at which such election shall be held, [as amended June 10,1987]
